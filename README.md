# hadith-hub

## Introduction

This project is designed to extract Hadith data from JSON files and structure it into a more organized format. The raw data used in this project is sourced from [Ahmed Abdelbaset's Hadith JSON Repository](https://github.com/A7med3bdulBaset/hadith-json), which scrapes its data from [sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com).

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afrcvn/hadith-hub.git
   cd hadith-hub
   ```
3. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
    This script processes Hadith data from JSON files in the 'raw' directory and saves the structured data to the 'hadiths' directory.

4. **Output:** Processed data will be saved as individual JSON files in the 'hadiths' directory.

## Project Structure

- `script.py`: The main Python script for processing Hadith data.
- `output/`: Directory where the processed data will be saved as individual JSON files.
